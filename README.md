# Nexus Project

> A modular, multi-language execution kernel in Java — learning while building production-grade software.

## Overview

The Nexus Project is an experimental system designed to allow programs written in multiple languages (C, C++, C#, Java, Rust, Go, Python, etc.) to run inside a controlled, secure environment. The goal is to explore **production-grade Java practices** while building a kernel that is **modular, secure, and extensible**.  

This project is a learning journey. The roadmap aims to keep the project **scalable and reusable**, even if the core features are developed gradually.

## Key Goals

- **Multi-language support**: Load and execute modules from different languages inside a single controlled environment.  
- **Security-focused**: Minimize external communication; any network access is explicit and controlled.  
- **Production-minded Java**: Learn and apply long-term support (LTS) Java practices (currently JDK 25).  
- **Extensibility**: Design patterns that can be applied to other languages and frameworks later.  
- **Developer-first architecture**: Avoid forcing external frameworks or tools; aim for simplicity and clarity.

## Current Status

- Core Java kernel initialized (learning mode).  
- Module loader and simple inter-language execution planned.  
- Networking and security hooks are under consideration.

## Roadmap

1. Set up a minimal Java kernel (current focus).  
2. Add support for a single external language module.  
3. Implement controlled network access.  
4. Expand multi-language module support.  
5. Refactor with production-grade architecture and coding standards.  
6. Build documentation and examples for other developers.

## Learning Objectives

- Apply LTS Java best practices in a real-world project.  
- Understand modular system architecture and inter-language communication.  
- Explore secure execution environments and controlled networking.  
- Practice iterative, production-minded software development.

## Contributing

This project is primarily a personal learning journey, but contributions, ideas, and guidance are welcome.

> Note: This project is intentionally experimental. Expect frequent refactoring as learning progresses. The goal is growth, not immediate perfection.
